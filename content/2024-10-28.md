The `Descriptor` data structure forms the backbone of the OCI spec's [content-addressible storage (CAS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content-addressable_storage). What is it?

> For the best, most in-depth documentation on Descriptors: <https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/v1.0.1/descriptor.md>

In Go it's represented by the following type:

```go
// https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/main/specs-go/v1/descriptor.go#L19-L50

type Descriptor struct {

	MediaType string `json:"mediaType"`

	Digest digest.Digest `json:"digest"`

	Size int64 `json:"size"`

	// other properties omitted for brevity
	// might explore some of them in another post
}
```

The Descriptor is the "atom" of OCI, and is the minimal required amount of information needed to fetch content from an OCI registry.

Reference example:

```json
{
  "mediaType": "application/vnd.zarf.layer.v1.blob",
  "digest": "sha256:4ff999f0bd81961b3aa6b2ac548c782674ccacbea1462ac05415e934d15cc805",
  "size": 10694,
}
```

## MediaType

> `"mediaType": "application/vnd.zarf.layer.v1.blob",`

MediaType is a MIME type and is a [RFC7231](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7231#section-3.1.1.1) compliant string.

In OCI land, the four most commonly seen are:

- manifest: `application/vnd.oci.image.manifest.v1+json`
- manifest config: `application/vnd.oci.image.config.v1+json`
- index: `application/vnd.oci.image.index.v1+json`
- "standard" layer: `application/vnd.oci.image.layer.v1.tar+gzip`

but the flexibility of this string is what allows for OCI to be able to store aribitary content like:

- Helm charts: `application/vnd.cncf.helm.chart.content.v1.tar+gzip`
- Zarf packages: `application/vnd.zarf.layer.v1.blob`
- Flux artifacts: `application/vnd.cncf.flux.content.v1.tar+gzip`

The `MediaType` is used to convey to clients what can be done with the described blob once it has been fetched (that is, parsed as JSON, unpacked w/ `tar`, etc...).

## Size

> `"size": 10694,`

`Size` (in bytes) serves as the first component in [content verification](https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec/blob/main/spec.md#content-verification).

When pushing/pulling content, `Size` **MUST** match the `Content-Length` header.

Size also allows for registries and conformant clients to support
[resumable push/pull](https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec/blob/main/spec.md#resumable-push) and
[chunked uploads](https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec/blob/main/spec.md#pushing-a-blob-in-chunks).

## Digest

> `"digest": "sha256:4ff999f0bd81961b3aa6b2ac548c782674ccacbea1462ac05415e934d15cc805",`

`Digest` is the final core component and is the most "expensive".

Before any content can be pushed, it must be hashed for
[content verification](https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec/blob/main/spec.md#content-verification)
as well as [deduplication](https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec/blob/main/spec.md#layer-upload-de-duplication)
purposes.

The two officially supported algorithms are SHA-256 and SHA-512.

## Bringing it all together

By leveraging the `MediaType` of content, implementations can perform easy content support checks.

By leveraging the `Size` of content, implementations can take advantage of more efficient pushing/pulling of content. Resuming pulls/pushes at the _byte_ level.

By leveraging the `Digest` of content as an address:

- Registries only need to store a single copy of a layer, even if it's used in a multitude of images.
- Clients can perform differential pushes/pulls, greatly speeding up CI times + reducing CPU cycles.

And what boils down to two short strings and a 64bit integer form the basis for a dead simple, yet extremely powerful [distribution](https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec/blob/main/spec.md) system.

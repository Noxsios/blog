> tldr; Zarf's latest [release (v0.28.0)](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/zarf/releases/tag/v0.28.0) contains a few cool improvements to its OCI (Open Container Initiative) library code and CLI options.

<!-- more -->

## Inline Publishing

There is now a new option for the destination of a Zarf package create!

```bash
zarf package create . -o oci://ghcr.io/defenseunicorns/packages
```

I call this guy _inline publishing_ because it is essentially the same thing as doing a `create` followed by a `publish`. This is useful for when you want to create a package and publish it to a registry in one step. In a future release, I plan to combine this with `differential` packages, so that you can publish a package and only pull images that have changed (saving massive amounts of time and bandwidth).

## Slimmer Deployments

Previously, when you did a `zarf package deploy oci://` with the `--components` flag, each and every layer from that package was pulled down before the package could be deployed. This was a bit of a pain, especially when you only wanted to deploy a single component.

Now, that same command will _only_ pull down the layers that are needed for the component(s) you are deploying (this functionality only occurs when you use `--confirm`, as you might specify other components interactively after the fact).

```bash
# only pulls down the layers needed for dubbd-aws (this is just an example)
zarf package deploy oci://ghcr.io/defenseunicorns/packages/dubbd-aws:0.3.0-amd64 --components dubbd-aws --confirm
```

## Removing an OCI package

Previously, in order to remove a package deployed via `zarf package deploy oci://`, you had to do a `zarf package pull && zarf package remove <tarball>`.

Now you can do:

```bash
# to remove all components
zarf package remove oci://ghcr.io/defenseunicorns/packages/dubbd-aws:0.3.0-amd64

# or to remove a specific component

zarf package remove oci://ghcr.io/defenseunicorns/packages/dubbd-aws:0.3.0-amd64 --components dubbd-aws
```

> The `--oci-concurrency` flag is now available on all `zarf package` commands that interact with OCI packages. This allows you to specify the number of concurrent pulls/pushes that can occur at once. It is also accessible via the `package.oci_concurrency` config value.

## Consuming Zarf as a Library

In [!1764](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/zarf/pull/1764), I re-wrote how our OCI library code (which uses the ORAS (OCI Registry As Storage) library under the hood) is accessed. Now you can easily do stuff like:

```go
import (
    "fmt"
    "path/filepath"

    "github.com/defenseunicorns/zarf/src/pkg/message"
    "github.com/defenseunicorns/zarf/src/pkg/oci"
)

func main() {
    ver := "0.3.0"
    arch := "amd64"
    url := fmt.Sprintf("ghcr.io/defenseunicorns/packages/dubbd-aws:%s-%s", ver, arch)

    // create a new client
    // auth checking is handled immediately
    client, err := oci.NewOrasRemote(url)
    if err != nil {
        message.Fatal(err, "Failed to create OCI client")
    }

    dst := filepath.Join("unpacked-dubbd-aws")
    err = utils.CreateDirectory(dst, 0755)
    if err != nil {
        message.Fatal(err, "Failed to create directory")
    }
    // pull the package into dst with a concurrency of 10
    err = client.PullPackage(dst, 10)
    if err != nil {
        message.Fatalf(err, "Failed to pull package %s", client.Reference)
    }

    // contents of the package are now in dst
    //
    // $ ls -R unpacked-dubbd-aws
    // 
    // zarf.yaml
    // checksums.txt
    // components/...
    // blobs/sha256/...
}
```

There are also a ton of other useful helper functions (like `PullPackageMetadata`, `FetchZarfYaml`, `LayersFromRequestedComponents` etc...) that you can use to build more advanced workflows.

Much of this work was a necessary precursor to the upcoming `zarf bundle` command and `bundler` library. I'm excited to share more about that soon!

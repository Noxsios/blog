## Backup + Restore Brew

Backups are critical, not matter what is being backed up. On MacOS the most popular package manager is [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). With a few simple commands backing up and restoring a brew environment is a breeze.

```bash
# backup, defaults to `Brewfile`
$ brew bundle dump

# view backup
$ cat Brewfile

# restore
$ brew bundle
```

View my `Brewfile` with explanations in this [post](brewfile.md).

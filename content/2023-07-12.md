> tldr; This will be a multi-part series on the upcoming Zarf `bundle` feature. This first post is a deep dive into the creation of a bundle. Most people reading this will get bored in 0.5s, so feel free to skip!

> Bundles are ever-evolving. This post is based on the current state of the feature, but may be out of date by the time you read it.

For an overview on bundles, please read the [ADR](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/zarf/blob/main/adr/0017-zarf-bundle.md)

## If you can't razzle them with brilliance...

...baffle(s) them with zarf. Enjoy this GIF of a `zarf bundle create`.

## Bundles are like onions

Bundles are collections of Zarf OCI packages that have been merged into a single OCI image, but must still retain their individuality so that existing package deployment mechanisms can be used with minimal changes. This is to allow for both a smooth transition to bundles, but also for rapid patching of individual packages without having to rebuild an entire bundle.

If A, B, C are Zarf packages, then bundle D = A + B + C:

```text

// Deploying all 3 individually must be the same as deploying the bundle
deploy(A) + deploy(B) + deploy(C) == deploy(D)

deploy(D) == deploy(A) + deploy(B) + deploy(C)

// Removal must also be atomic
remove(D) == remove(A) + remove(B) + remove(C)

deploy(D) + remove(A) == deploy(B) + deploy(C)
```

## `zarf-bundle.yaml` schema

Bundles will follow a new YAML schema, `zarf-bundle.yaml`. This schema utilizes portions of the `zarf.yaml` schema (notably `metadata` and `build`), but focuses on orchestrating _packages_, not _components_.

```yaml
metadata:
  name: bundle
  description: a bundle
  version: 0.0.1

packages:

  - repository: localhost:888/init
    ref: "###ZARF_BNDL_TMPL_INIT_VERSION###"
    optional-components:
      - git-server
    public-key: |-
        -----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
        MFkwEwYHKoZIzj0CAQYIKoZIzj0DAQcDQgAEGXxUhVYpuKyWNXFwjaRKiNHQcKyI
        wjoIQCI8Th5WS/Bkbmxxbxa7v20c+w9DgyeB450qsGJoaFh+uMhdbSwlCA==
        -----END PUBLIC KEY-----

  - repository: localhost:889/manifests
    ref: 0.0.1
    optional-components:
      - "*" # grab all components
```

## `bundle create`

The `bundle create` command operates similar to the `zarf package create` command, with one key difference:

- The output is __only__ an OCI reference, not a directory `bundle create <directory> -o oci://<reference>`

At this time, both the source of a bundle's packages, and the resulting bundle are only stored in OCI registries. This may change in the future, but for now, it's the only supported method (pulling down into a tarball + deploying a bundle from a local tarball _will be_ supported however).

### Creation Madness

The `bundle create` command is a bit of a beast (`src/pkg/bundler/create.go`).

1. `cd` into the provided directory containing the `zarf-bundle.yaml` file
2. Read the `zarf-bundle.yaml` file into memory
3. Template the `zarf-bundle.yaml` file, replacing `###ZARF_BNDL_TMPL_*###` with the appropriate values
4. Populate the `build` key with current build information
5. Validate access to all of the packages in the `packages` key + validate package signatures w/ public key (if provided + signed)
   1. This also verifies the `optional-components` key, ensuring that all components specified exist, match the bundle's architecture, and expands wildcards (`*`, `aws-*`, etc)
   2. This also mutates the `ref` key to the full OCI reference of the package (a la `localhost:888/init:v0.28.2@<sha256>...`), you will see why when we get to `bundle pull`
6. Build a new OCI client to the provided OCI registry, ref: `<user provided>/<metadata.name>:<metadata.version>-<metadata.arch`
7. Sign the bundle (if desired)
8. Create the bundle on the OCI registry
9. Profit

### You are doing what?

There are two ways a package gets merged into a bundle:

- If the package is on the same registry as the bundle, the package's layers are blob mounted into the bundle's manifest

> blob mounting is a very efficient means of getting data into an OCI image, as it doesn't require any data to be transferred, only performing a few HTTP requests to make the layers from one image available to another

- If the package is on a different registry than the bundle, the package's layers are downloaded, and then uploaded to the bundle's registry. __PSYCH!__ Why download and re-upload when we can just pipe the two requests together and stream the layers from one repository to another without ever touching the disk? _thats exactly what I did_

This results in a manifest that looks like the below:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 2,
  "config": {
    "mediaType": "application/vnd.oci.image.config.v1+json",
    "digest": "sha256:64b63c9478c2fc5fc9f733159720d41e490dcc617c773b745568f12310d42ffb",
    "size": 153
  },
  "layers": [
    {
      "mediaType": "application/vnd.oci.image.manifest.v1+json",
      "digest": "sha256:36a8a87e199aacdf0e10be48758093e31076c93d98e7c53f4df3e8fdf69371d3",
      "size": 20869
    },
    {
      "mediaType": "application/vnd.oci.image.manifest.v1+json",
      "digest": "sha256:60e4fb5cdd71dfc11ff7fdb652fd5980ab375a5a7db7316ce75396738fab5b22",
      "size": 8327
    },
    {
      "mediaType": "application/vnd.zarf.layer.v1.blob",
      "digest": "sha256:f422ba8364518056f9c86fcf860c3bd482c778d26600e6dfe65f8e83710fb83b",
      "size": 579,
      "annotations": {
        "org.opencontainers.image.title": "zarf-bundle.yaml"
      }
    }
  ],
  "annotations": {
    "org.opencontainers.image.description": "a bundle"
  }
}
```

Storing the source package's manifests as layers in the bundle's manifest preserves chain of custody and allows for some fancy expansion during `bundle pull` (more on that later).

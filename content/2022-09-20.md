My exploration adding Playwright end-to-end testing during a
UI MVP for the Zarf CLI tool.

## Overview of zarf-ui

[`zarf`](https://zarf.dev/) is a CLI tool written in Go for airgapping Kubernetes deployments.  Facing a potential use case where a user may be very unfamiliar with deploying K8s, given miminal training, and a requirement that the job must be completed; a GUI for this powerful tool needed to be created.

The frontend/UI is written in [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) with components derived from [Material](https://material.io), the backend is a restful Go API that exposes (_nearly_) the same functionality as the CLI tool.

Frontend: `http://localhost:5137` 

Backend: `http://127.0.0.1:3333`

> the frontend build tool [`vite`](https://vitejs.dev/) prefers `localhost` to `127.0.0.1`

Using `vite`, the backend is proxied to the frontend with the below:

```ts
// vite.config.ts

const backendAPI = {
  target: 'http://127.0.0.1:3333',
  changeOrigin: true,
  secure: false,
  ws: true,
}

const config: UserConfig = {
  ...
  server: {
    proxy: {
      '/api': backendAPI,
    },
  },
  ...
}
```

This allows the frontend to make api calls to `localhost:5173/api/some_endpoint`, and the true backend server respond.

## Adding playwright to zarf

I have previous experience using Playwright in another project, and I was able to get the initial scaffolding down using:

```bash
npm init playwright@latest
```

### Moving tests dir

Due to the structure of `zarf`, the tests were moved from `tests` to `src/test/ui`.  And the relevant line in the `playwright.config.ts` changed to:

```ts
const config: PlaywrightTestConfig = {
  testDir: './src/test/ui',
  ...
}
```

### Pairing with frontend ui + backend api flow

Staring the frontend + backend can be accomplished w/ `npm run dev`.

Under the hood, this starts the `vite` dev server at the same time as our backend API.

```ts
❯ npm run dev

> zarf-ui@0.0.1 dev
> API_DEV_PORT=5173 API_PORT=3333 API_TOKEN=insecure concurrently --names "ui,api" -c "gray.bold,yellow" "vite dev" "nodemon -e go -x 'go run main.go dev ui -l=trace || exit 1'"

[api] [nodemon] 2.0.19
[api] [nodemon] to restart at any time, enter `rs`
[api] [nodemon] watching path(s): src/**/*
[api] [nodemon] watching extensions: go
[api] [nodemon] starting `go run main.go dev ui -l=trace || exit 1`
[ui]
[ui]   VITE v3.1.0  ready in 513 ms
[ui]
[ui]   ➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
[ui]   ➜  Network: use --host to expose
...
  DEBUG   api.LaunchAPIServer()
[api] └ (/Users/razzle/dev/zarf/src/internal/message/message.go:103)
[api]   •  Zarf UI connection: http://127.0.0.1:5173/auth?token=insecure
```

> Note the above Zarf UI connection URL.  In production builds, the token value will be a unique string created by the backend at runtime, this will provide some basic API auth/security.
> 
> Using the UI is only possible after going to this auth endpoint, as the token is set in `window.sessionStorage` (a hack for now, but its just to get things working)
> 

With this knowledge in mind, utilizing the [webServer](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-advanced#launching-a-development-web-server-during-the-tests) config option in Playwright, we can wire this call directly into our test runner.

```ts
const config: PlaywrightTestConfig = {
  ...
  webServer: {
    command: 'npm run dev',
    port: 3333,
    reuseExistingServer: true,
    timeout: 120 * 1000
  },
  use: {
    baseURL: 'http://localhost:5173'
  }
  ...
}
```

Now when we run our tests w/ `npx playwright test`, our dev frontend+backend servers are created beforehand, and destroyed after.

> By specifying port `3333` (the backend) as the webServer port, we can have `playwright` wait for that port to be live before it runs the tests. (the frontend builds much faster than the backend compiles)

## Writing the first test

For the first test, we will check that we are able to navigate to the homepage, and the page title is as expected.

```ts
// src/test/ui/home.spec.ts
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test.describe('homepage', () => {
  test('has `Zarf UI` in title', async ({ page }) => {
    // navigate to UI root / homepage
    await page.goto('/');

    // Expect a title "to contain" a substring.
    await expect(page).toHaveTitle(/Zarf UI/);
    // ^ some playwright asssertions allow you 
    // to have RegEx as the expected output
  });
});
```

Playwright is asynchronous by nature, so get used to `await`'ing a lot of steps.

## Dealing with API authentication

The API is protected by an auth token created upon API instantiation. Currently
this token gets stored in sessionStorage after navigating to the `/auth?token=<token>` route. 

Originally, I wrote some code that would set the dev token `insecure` within playwright's `sessionStorage`.

```ts
    test.beforeEach(async ({ context }) => {
        // this is gross ⬇️
        await context.addInitScript(() => {
            window.sessionStorage.setItem('token', 'insecure');
        });
    });
```

This then became:

```ts
test.beforeEach(async ({ page }) => {
    await page.goto('/auth?token=insecure')
});
```

which was later refactored with a built in redirect:

```ts
test('some test', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/auth?token=insecure&next=<some route>');
  ...
}
```

This final solution prevents the need for a `test.beforeEach` function usage to set the API auth token.

It also allows for using much better and secure auth flows later down the road (like HTTP-only cookies) but not directly setting the auth token in `sessionStorage`.

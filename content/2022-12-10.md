Out of every JavaScript framework out there, why Svelte?

<!-- more -->

## Foreward

If you have at all been involved in the JavaScript game for the past five or so years,
you have witnessed the birth of a _metric ton_ of new frameworks. Stealing a meme from
[Fireship](https://www.youtube.com/c/Fireship), this is how it feels sometimes as a JS dev:

![Every two weeks in the JS ecosystem](https://yt3.ggpht.com/oFIfXatGGl0MAsJgmaWfsptcg5EEtAKuYN1FawRgfK9TWLZ6vY0AndQBqRNo9ccJMOMSbsvvSAbbJg=s800-nd-v1)

I can [promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)
you that this churn isn't going to stop anytime soon. By the time you finish reading this, I bet the framework
comparisons will be out of date, and like all design decisions: choosing a framework incurs tradeoffs. In this post,
I will try to explain why Svelte in combination with SvelteKit is the chosen JavaScript framework for ðŸ¦„.

### What even is Svelte?

As a primer, I highly recommend you watch the below video:

### So why not React?

> I do not consider myself a React expert, but I have used it for a few years now.

I started out as a React web dev in the very first training cohort from
the [Airmen Coders](https://airmencoders.us/) program, and most people
who go through bootcamps like this one end up using React. I have nothing
against React, and I think it's a great framework; but it does possess some major downsides:

- **React is a library, not a framework.**  This means that you have to
  bring your own router, state management, and other tools. This is
  fine, but it means that you have to learn a lot of different tools
  to get a React app up and running. This is a big barrier to entry
  for new developers, and it means that React apps tend to be
  monolithic and hard to maintain.
- **React is a DSL.**  This means that you have to learn a new language
  to write React apps. (JSX + React Hooks + React Functional/Class Components)
- **React gets slow too quickly** (opinion) I have found that React apps
  tend to get slow and bloated with time and require additional dev cycles
  to optimize. This is partly due to the fact that React utilizes the virtual-dom
  pattern, a core design decision that isn't going to change anytime soon.
- **React's ecosystem is huge**. _wait_ you may be saying, isn't that a good thing?
  Well, yes and no. It is great that there are so many tools and libraries
  to choose from, but it also means that for every tool you `npm install`, you
  are adding that much more vulnerability surface area to your app. (just using `create-react-app` adds 1,500+ packages to your app)
- **React's lifecyle management is a mess**. I have found that React's
  lifecycle management is a bit of a mess, and it's easy to perform bad state management
  practices to get to a working app.
  (yes if you are performing good code reviews, following best practices,
  have a thorough understanding of JavaScript + React rendering, and are using a linter,
  you can avoid this, but it's still a pain point)

There are other reasons why one would not choose React in 2022, but these are the
biggest ones for me.

> React's popularity isn't a factor in my mind for adoption. Usability, performance, developer experience, vulnerability, and maintainability are much more important factors.

### Why Svelte?

> Some of these key points were <s>stolen</s> borrowed from <https://escape.tech/blog/from-vue2-to-svelte/>

Per the [Svelte website](https://svelte.dev/), it champions three key features:

1. Write less code - [article](https://svelte.dev/blog/write-less-code)
2. No virtual DOM - [article](https://svelte.dev/blog/virtual-dom-is-pure-overhead)
3. Truly reactive - [article](https://svelte.dev/blog/svelte-3-rethinking-reactivity)

With this, Svelte is designed around writing as little, but still readable, JavaScript as possible while delivering high performance.

#### Write less code

For instance, this is a simple counter app in React:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from "react";

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </>
  );
}

export default Counter;
```

And here is the same app in Svelte:

```html
<script>
  let count = 0;
</script>

<p>Count: {count}</p>
<button on:click={() => count += 1}>Increment</button>
```

Much easier to read right? This is because Svelte is a compiler, not a library. It compiles your code down to vanilla JavaScript.

In addition to readability, Svelte also has a few other features that make it easier to write less code:

- No need for any `<div>`, `<> </>` or `<template` wrappers like in React/Vue
- Styles are component scoped by default
- Conditional logic and loops are built in (no need for ternary operators or `map` functions)
- Since Svelte makes vanilla JS apps, you can use any JS library you want (no need for React hooks or Vue composition API)
- Easy cross-component communication with [stores](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/writable-stores), [context](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/context-api), etc...

#### SvelteKit

SvelteKit is the official Svelte framework for building web apps. It is a
primarily server-side rendered framework that uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
under the hood for building (think of it as the Next.js for Svelte).

> For current ðŸ¦„ design patterns, we are using SvelteKit with the static adapter and server-side rendering (SSR) turned off.
>
> I have omitted some of the SSR features from this post because they're not relevant to our current design patterns.

The main features SvelteKit provides are:

- [file-based routing](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/routing)
- Clean interop with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for building
- Out-of-the-box Typescript support

### Why not Vue/Angular/Solid/Blazor/Next/Insert Framework here?

**Yes** I know that there are other frameworks out there that are great:

![State of JS 2021](https://stateofx-images.netlify.app/captures/js2021/en-US/front_end_frameworks_experience_ranking.png)

At the end of the day, design decisions are all about tradeoffs. I have
found that Svelte w/ SvelteKit is the best frontend experience because it _combines_ the best features of many others, while _minimizing_ the downsides:

- Great performance + small bundle size (the less JavaScript you ship to the client, the better)
- Simple syntax (closest to vanilla JS as possible) that combines the best parts of React and Vue
- Minimal dependencies
- Excellent [documentation + tutorial system](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/basics)
- Easy state management in combination with data fetching
- Easy routing (after learning some SvelteKit concepts)
- Easy to learn (if you know JavaScript, you can learn Svelte in a day)

I am available at all times to answer questions about Svelte or convince you why your framework <s>sucks</s> isn't the best for ðŸ¤ºðŸ¦„.

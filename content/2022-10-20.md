> tldr; Let's (attempt to) write a Docker API spec compliant static container registry (no _push_, only _pull_) in Rust and optimize the binary size to be as small as possible. This is part of an effort to replace stage2 (`zarf-registry`) during `zarf init` with an implementation in the already existing stage1 (`zarf-injector`) binary. This will be a multi-part series, so stay tuned!

## Part 1: Rust Size Optimization

### Stage 1's Existing Size + Behavior

Stage 1's Rust binary (`zarf-injector`) [src](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/zarf/tree/master/src/injector/stage1) performs a few operations. It's main goal is to extract the seed Crane Docker Registry image tarball (`seed-image.tar`) and our stage 2 binary (`zarf-registry`) into a running Docker container.

1. It merges all of the `zarf-payload-*` configmaps back into a single tarball, then extracts to the `/zarf-stage2` directory.
2. It runs `chmod 755` on the `/zarf-stage2` directory (due to [windows](2022-10-04.md#there-is-no-chmod-x-in-windows) compatibility issues).

This binary is compiled against the `aarch64-linux-musl-ar` target for M1 Macs, and `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl` for x86_64 Linux.

> `musl` is used instead of `gnu` because it's a smaller target. `musl` is a libc implementation that's used in Alpine Linux, and is more lightweight than `gnu`. It's also used in the `scratch` image, which is the smallest image possible.

```bash
x86_64_size=$(du --si target/x86_64-unknown-linux-musl/release/zarf-injector | cut -f1)
echo "x86_64 binary size: $x86_64_size"

aarch_arm_64_size=$(du --si target/release/zarf-injector | cut -f1)
echo "aarch64 binary size: $aarch_arm_64_size"

---

x86_64 binary size: 528k
aarch64 binary size: 373k
```

Not bad! But we can do better.

> For reference: running a standard `cargo build --release` on M1 with no optimizations is ~ 700kb.

### Let's Get Small

Currently, this Rust binary has the following settings in the `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[profile.release]
opt-level = "z"  # Optimize for size.
lto = true
codegen-units = 1
panic = "abort"
strip = true
```

There is a great writeup [here](https://github.com/johnthagen/min-sized-rust) on optimizing Rust binary sizes.

From the preceding, we're already using [`strip` Symbols from Binary](https://github.com/johnthagen/min-sized-rust#strip-symbols-from-binary), [Optimize For Size](https://github.com/johnthagen/min-sized-rust#optimize-for-size),
[Enable Link Time Optimization](https://github.com/johnthagen/min-sized-rust#enable-link-time-optimization-lto), [Reduce Parallel Code Generation Units](https://github.com/johnthagen/min-sized-rust#reduce-parallel-code-generation-units-to-increase-optimization), and
[Abort on Panic](https://github.com/johnthagen/min-sized-rust#abort-on-panic).

Following some of the other suggestions, we can get the binary size down to 156kb.

In this implementation, we're re-compiling `libstd` from nightly, instead of using the pre-compiled version. This is because the pre-compiled version isn't optimized for size, and isn't stripped.

> "This is where [`build-std`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/unstable.html#build-std) comes in. The build-std feature is able to compile libstd with your application from the source. It does this with the rust-src component that rustup conveniently provides." ~ min-sized-rust

```bash
rustup toolchain install nightly
rustup component add rust-src --toolchain nightly
cargo +nightly build -Z build-std=std,panic_abort -Z build-std-features=panic_immediate_abort \
    --target aarch64-apple-darwin --release

aarch_arm_64_size=$(du --si target/aarch64-apple-darwin/release/zarf-injector | cut -f1)
echo "aarch64 binary size: $aarch_arm_64_size"

rustup +nightly target add x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
cargo +nightly build -Z build-std=std,panic_abort -Z build-std-features=panic_immediate_abort \
    --target x86_64-unknown-linux-musl --release

x86_64_size=$(du --si target/x86_64-unknown-linux-musl/release/zarf-injector | cut -f1)
echo "x86_64 binary size: $x86_64_size"

---

aarch64 binary size: 156k
x86_64 binary size: 176k
```

> __This accomplishes a 66% decrease in binary size!__

There are further optimizations that can be made, but for now this is as unstable as we want to get.

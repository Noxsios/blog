## Pulling the Manifest

## Getting aHEAD of Ourselves

Before a manifest is pulled, it is queried via a `HEAD` request.

```text
HEAD /v2/<name>/manifests/<reference>
```

```bash
# 666 is a local-hosted real docker registry
$ curl -I localhost:666/v2/registry/manifests/2.8.1 -H "Accept: application/vnd.docker.distribution.manifest.v2+json"

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Length: 1363

Looking at our crane manifest, this `sha256:d8ce...` is nowhere to be found. So what the heck is it?

### The Actual Pull

Per the API spec, this route looks like:

```text
GET /v2/<name>/manifests/<reference>
```

where `name` is the name of the image (statically `library/registry` in this case), and `reference` is the tag of the image (in this case we dont care what `reference` is, we will only be serving one image for every reference).

Checking this endpoint with cURL:

```bash
$ $ docker tag registry:2.8.1 localhost:666/registry:2.8.1
$ $ docker push localhost:666/registry:2.8.1

$ curl localhost:666/v2/registry/manifests/2.8.1

# truncated example
{
   "name": <name>,
   "tag": <tag>,
   "fsLayers": [
      {
         "blobSum": <digest>
      },
      ...
    ]
   ],
   "history": <v1 images>,
   "signature": <JWS>
}
```

By default, the Docker registry is going to provide a v1 manifest. We can force it to provide a v2 manifest by setting the `Accept` header to `application/vnd.docker.distribution.manifest.v2+json`:

```bash
$ curl localhost:666/v2/registry/manifests/2.8.1 -H "Accept: application/vnd.docker.distribution.manifest.v2+json"

# truncated v2 example
{
  "schemaVersion": 2,
  "mediaType": "application/vnd.docker.distribution.manifest.v2+json",
  "config": {
    "mediaType": "application/vnd.docker.container.image.v1+json",
    "size": <size>,
    "digest": <digest>
  },
  "layers": [
    {
      "mediaType": "application/vnd.docker.image.rootfs.diff.tar.gzip",
      "size": <int>,
      "digest": <digest>
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

v1 is basically dead, and I really didn't feel like supporting it, so for every request to `/v2/registry/manifests/<reference>`, we will return a v2/OCI manifest.

But wait, we dont have a v2 manifest!  We have a Crane manifest from our `seed-image.tar` [Crane tarball format](https://github.com/google/go-containerregistry/blob/main/pkg/v1/tarball/README.md).

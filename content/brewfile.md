My current Brewfile explained.  Some entries (like `gcc`) are omitted because they are self explanatory, 
while others (like `helm`) are omitted because they are much more commonly known.  This leaves, lesser known and hopefully
helpful programs.  Enjoy!

For all my tools I like using the `macchiato` color scheme from [catpuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin)

## Who Cares?

Well, Jeff told me my job was on the line if I didn't do it, so that was reason enough for me to implement. _(for legal reasons that was a joke)_

But in all seriousness anyone who develops [Zarf](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/zarf) packages should take note and try out this pretty slick feature.

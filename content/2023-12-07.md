> tldr; The newly introduced `zarf dev deploy` can greatly speed up Zarf package dev cycles.

## Who Cares?

Well, Jeff told me my job was on the line if I didn't do it, so that was reason enough for me to implement. _(for legal reasons that was a joke)_

But in all seriousness anyone who develops [Zarf](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/zarf) packages should take note and try out this pretty slick feature.

## If It Ain't Broke Make It Better

![it can be better](https://media1.tenor.com/m/SMkXNFf_aIkAAAAC/max-lord-maxwell-lord.gif)

The Zarf package debug / development feedback loop is highly situational depending upon the bug encountered / feature being added. Generally though, it follows:

1. Create/edit a `zarf.yaml` file and components
2. Build the package w/ `zarf package create`
3. Debug any _create_ errors and resolve by editing the `zarf.yaml` and repeating step 2
4. Run `zarf init` against a fresh running cluster
5. Deploy the local tarball w/ `zarf package deploy <tb>`
6. Debug any _deploy_ errors and resolve by editing `zarf.yaml` and repeating steps 2 or 5

If there are deployment errors, the common pattern is to reset the cluster (ex: `k3d cluster delete && k3d cluster create`) and repeat steps 4-6. Re-initializing the cluster, recreating the package, and redeploying the package is tedious and time consuming (~1.5 minutes on my beast of a dev machine); especially when the package is large or the change was small.

So what's the bottlekneck?

The foundation of Zarf is turning technologies geared towards fully connected environments and making them air-gap native.

As such, `zarf package create` is designed and architected around a zero knowledge approach. It **cannot** make any assumptions about the connected nature of the environment it is being created for (unless `.metadata.yolo == true`). This means that any dependencies referenced (whether they be container images, `git` repos, `helm` charts, files, etc...) **must** be retrieved / assembled _each_ and _every_ run.

There already exists the concept of [`YOLO` mode](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/zarf/blob/main/adr/0010-yolo-mode.md), which can build + deploy a package without the need for `zarf init`, and builds without fetching certain heavy dependencies (like Docker images). However, `YOLO` mode is not exposed via CLI flags, and is meant to develop and deploy packages in fully connected environments.

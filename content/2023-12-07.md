## Who cares?

Well, [Jeff](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffsmccoy/) told me my job was on the line if I didn't do it, so that was reason enough for me to implement. _(for legal reasons that was a joke)_

But in all seriousness anyone who develops [Zarf](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/zarf) packages should take note and try out this pretty slick feature.

## If it ain't broke make it better

![it can be better](https://media1.tenor.com/m/SMkXNFf_aIkAAAAC/max-lord-maxwell-lord.gif)

The Zarf package debug/development feedback loop varies significantly depending on the encountered bug or added feature. Generally though, the cycle follows:

1. Create/edit a `zarf.yaml` file and components
2. Build the package w/ `zarf package create`
3. Debug any _create_ errors and resolve by editing the `zarf.yaml` and repeating step 2
4. Run `zarf init` against a fresh running cluster
5. Deploy the local tarball w/ `zarf package deploy <tb>`
6. Debug any _deploy_ errors and resolve by editing `zarf.yaml` and repeating steps 2 or 5

If there are deployment errors, the common pattern is to reset the cluster (ex: `k3d cluster delete && k3d cluster create`) and repeat steps 4-6. Re-initializing the cluster, recreating the package, and redeploying the package is tedious and time consuming (~1.5 minutes on my beast of a dev machine); especially when the package is large or the change was small.

So what's the bottleneck?

The foundation of Zarf is turning technologies geared towards fully connected environments and making them air-gap native.

As such, `zarf package create` is designed around a zero knowledge approach. It **can't** make any assumptions about the connected nature of the environment it's being created for (unless `.metadata.yolo == true`). This means that any dependencies referenced (whether they are container images, `git` repos, `helm` charts, files, etc...) **must** be retrieved/assembled _each_ and _every_ run.

There already exists the concept of [`YOLO` mode](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/zarf/blob/main/adr/0010-yolo-mode.md), which can build + deploy a package without the need for `zarf init`, and builds without fetching certain heavy dependencies (like container images). However, `YOLO` mode isn't exposed via CLI flags, and is meant to develop and deploy packages in fully connected environments.

## The new hotness

Starting with Zarf `v0.32.0`, the `zarf dev deploy` command is available.

> `zarf dev deploy` has a number of flags that closely match a combination of flags from `zarf package create` and `zarf package deploy`, but there are some differences (for example `--set` is split between `--create-set` and `--deploy-set`)
>
> To view all the flags run `zarf dev deploy --help`

`zarf dev deploy` combines the lifecycle of `zarf package create` and `zarf package deploy` into one command. It also has the following features:

- No `--confirm` or interactive prompts (it's dev mode after all)
- Only builds & deploys components that _will_ be deployed (contrasting with a traditional `zarf package create` which builds _all_ components each time)
- Can create & deploy in either YOLO mode (default) or prod mode (similar to a regular `zarf package create`)

If the current goal is to test whether or not a package's Helm charts, Kustomizations, K8s manifests, etc... work properly; a normal `zarf dev deploy` will suffice.

If the current goal is to more closely replicate a full `zarf package create && zarf package deploy`: `zarf dev deploy --no-yolo` is more the move.

> NOTE:
>
> In order for `zarf dev deploy --no-yolo` to function, `zarf init` must be run first.
> There may be an introduction of `zarf dev init` to speed this process up, but for now this is the current strategy. The speed benefits of `zarf dev deploy` combined with it being marked as [`[beta]`](https://docs.zarf.dev/docs/roadmap#beta) lead the team to believe it was better to get the feature out the door and into the hands of users rather than wait for the _entire_ devx experience to be revamped.

## What changed

In order to enable `zarf dev deploy` to be possible, there was some cleanup that had to happen to some lifecycle helper functions during `create`.

As a result, `create` has been distilled down into three high level stages (each with their own sub helpers).

- `load`
  - Read the `zarf.yaml` into memory
  - Resolve component `import`s + apply `flavor` + `only` filtering
  - Apply `PKG_TMPL` variables to the `zarf.yaml`
  - Process `extension`s
- `assemble`
  - Run `onCreate` actions before + after assembling all components + dependencies into a fresh `/tmp/zarf-*` directory
  - Pull images + OCI artifacts
  - Generate SBOMs
- `output`
  - Tarball up each `component`s dependency directory
  - Generate package `checksums.txt`
  - Generate build metadata + write the in-memory `zarf.yaml` to temp
  - Sign the `zarf.yaml` (if provided a key)
  - Publish to an OCI registry or create a local tarball

For `zarf dev deploy`, only `load` and `assemble` are run. Using existing `create` logic, pulling `images` and generating SBOMs is controlled via the `--no-yolo` flag.

In contrast to `zarf package create`, after the `load` function has run, `zarf dev deploy` uses a helper function from `deploy` to filter down the components even more than `--flavor` and `--arch`.

The results of these lifecycle changes results in a command that's **blazingly** fast at taking a `zarf.yaml` and applying it to a local cluster. See for yourself:

## Takeaway

The introduction of `zarf dev deploy` in Zarf version 0.32.0+ marks a significant leap in the development workflow for Zarf packages. This streamlined command combines the creation and deployment process, offering a faster and more efficient way to test and deploy packages in both YOLO and production modes.

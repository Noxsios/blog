A quick dive into some issues making [`zarf`](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/zarf) Windows compatible.

<!-- more -->

## Setup Windows dev environment

1. Remote desktop into a Windows 11 machine on my network
2. Install deps w/ [`scoop`](https://scoop.sh/) _(its like brew for windows)_

    ```powershell
    scoop install git curl make go nodejs k9s kubectl kind gpg
    ```

3. Startup Docker w/ the [`WSL2 backend`](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/wsl/)
4. Provision a fresh cluster w/

    ```powershell
    kind create cluster
    ```

5. Clone zarf w/ Github command-line tool

    ```powershell
    gh repo clone defenseunicorns/zarf
    cd zarf
    ```

6. Setup GPG Git signing - [Github docs](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/generating-a-new-gpg-key)
7. Tell Git where to find GPG:

    ```powershell
    # replace <user> with your username
    git config --global gpg.program "C:\Users\<user>\scoop\apps\gpg\current\bin\gpg.exe"
    ```

8. Start developing

## Adding a new build target to the Makefile

Adding a new build target to the [`Makefile`](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/zarf/blob/master/Makefile) was simple.

I wasn't looking to make the Makefile Windows compatible, just create a Windows build target.

Once the binary is built, the experience should be 1:1 on *nix, so there is little need to refactor the build system.

```makefile
...
ZARF_BIN := ./build/zarf
...
ifeq ($(OS),Windows_NT)
    ZARF_BIN := $(addsuffix -windows-amd64.exe,$(ZARF_BIN))
else
...
build-cli-windows-amd: build-injector-registry-amd build-ui
    GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build -ldflags="$(BUILD_ARGS)" -o build/zarf-windows-amd64.exe main.go
...
build-cli: build-cli-linux-amd build-cli-linux-arm build-cli-mac-intel build-cli-mac-apple build-cli-windows-amd ## Build the CLI
...
```

> at the time of writing this, I was only looking to get x86_64 Windows support, ARM is a future ask

## Fixing filepaths

Since Windows uses `\` as a path separator any code doing manual path joins/concatenation needed to be refactored.

> Modern Windows is pretty chill about file paths using `/`, but it's best to be safe and utilize Go's native OS handling

examples:

```go
// src/internal/helm/utils.go
import (
    ...
    "path/filepath"
    ...
)

// StandardName generates a predictable full path for a helm chart for Zarf
func StandardName(destination string, chart types.ZarfChart) string {
    return destination + "/" + chart.Name + "-" + chart.Version
}
// becomes
func StandardName(destination string, chart types.ZarfChart) string {
    return filepath.Join(destination, chart.Name+"-"+chart.Version)
}
```

```go
// src/internal/packager/validate/validate.go
import (
    ...
    "os"
    "path/filepath"
    "strings"
    ...
)
    ...
    // add a forward slash to end of path if it doesn't have one
    if .strings.HasSuffix(path, "/") {
        path = path + "/"
    }
    ...
    // becomes
    if .strings.HasSuffix(path, string(os.PathSeparator)) {
        path = filepath.Clean(path) + string(os.PathSeparator)
    }
```

## Troubleshooting `zarf init`

At this point compiling works just fine:

```powershell
$ make build-cli-windows-amd && ls build

    Directory: C:\bin\zarf\build

Mode                 LastWriteTime         Length Name
----                 -------------         ------ ----
d----           10/4/2022  4:42 PM                ui
-a---           10/4/2022  4:42 PM       13119488 zarf-registry-amd64
-a---           10/4/2022  4:42 PM      101293056 zarf-windows-amd64.exe
```

> `&&` works because I am using PowerShell Version 7+

__But `zarf init` fails.__

```powershell
$ cd build
$ kind delete cluster && kind create cluster
$ .\zarf-windows-amd64.exe init -l=trace

# very long output omitted for sanity

panic: runtime error: index out of range [0] with length 0

Super clear error message am I right?

After a few short hours of troubleshooting, I was able to trace the root of the issue to `src\internal\packager\injector.go`.

For some context, when zarf initializes it spins up an `injector` pod in the `zarf` namespace. This pod carries out two stages.

There are two VolumeMounts created for this pod, `zarf-stage1` which is a collection of __ConfigMaps__, and `zarf-stage2` which is initialized as an __EmptyDir__ _(this distinciton is important later on)_.

### `init-injector`

In stage1 (run in an InitContainer), the cleverly designed Rust binary [`zarf-injector`](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/zarf/tree/master/src/injector/stage1) is mounted into the pod and used to create `/zarf-stage2/seed-image.tar`.

### `injector`

Ok, stage2, hype city. In this stage the internal registry is populated using the Go binary `/zarf-stage2/zarf-registry`.

Looking at the logs in `injector`, this is where the core issue lies.

```text
$ kubectl describe pods/injector -n zarf | Select-String Message:

Message:      failed to create containerd task: failed to create shim task: 
OCI runtime create failed: runccreate failed: unable to start container 
process: exec: "/zarf-stage2/zarf-registry": permission denied: unknown
```

From this message, the issue is that there is a permission issue on `/zarf-stage2/zarf-registry`.

Swapping the container image to `ubuntu`, and changing `injector`'s startup command to `["ls", "-la"]`, I got these interesting results:

```text
# stage2's contents when run on mac
drwxrwxrwx 2 root root 4096 Oct 3 22:55 .
drwxr-xr-x 1 root root 4096 Oct 3 22:55 ..
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 9278976 Oct 3 22:55 seed-image.tar
-rwx------ 1 root root 12582912 Oct 3 22:55 zarf-registry

# stage2's contents when run on windows
drwxrwxrwx 2 root root 4096 Oct 3 22:49 .
drwxr-xr-x 1 root root 4096 Oct 3 22:49 ..
-rw-rw-rw- 1 root root 9951232 Oct 3 22:48 seed-image.tar
-rw-rw-rw- 1 root root 13119488 Oct 3 22:48 zarf-registry
```

__so why the permissions mismatch?__

> __Answer__: differences between *nix file systems and Windows file system

### There is no `chmod +x` in Windows

Windows doesn't determine if a file is executable via a filesystem flag, it determines via filename.

Anything on `$PATH` that ends in `.exe` is an executable. However, our Rust/Golang Linux compiled binaries __do not__.

So... during the interim stage, when our `zarf-init-amd64.tar.zst` is unpacked into a temporary directory...
__all files lose ability to be executed__.

> _This is where the fun begins_

__EmptyDir__ doesn't have the ability to `chmod` itself upon instantiation, but __ConfigMaps__ do.

So let's leverage our already existing hack (`zarf-injector`) to `chmod 777 /zarf-stage2/*`.

```rust
// src/injector/stage1/src/main.rs
use glob::glob;
use std::os::unix::fs::PermissionsExt;

fn chmod777(path: &str) {
    println.("chmod 777 {}", path);
    fs::set_permissions(path, PermissionsExt::from_mode(0o777)).unwrap();
}

fn main() {
    ...

    for entry in glob("/zarf-stage2/**/*").unwrap() {
        match entry {
            Ok(path) => chmod777(path.to_str().unwrap()),
            Err(e) => println.("{:?}", e),
        }
    }
}
```

Using the `build-rust-injector.yml` workflow to release an alpha version of this new Rust binary, and changing the `init` package's refs:

```yaml
# packages/zarf-injector/zarf.yaml

...

components:
  - name: zarf-injector
    only:
      cluster:
        architecture: amd64
    ...
    files:
      # Rust Injector Binary
      - source: sget://defenseunicorns/zarf-injector:amd64-v0.20.0-32-alpha
      ...

  - name: zarf-injector
    only:
      cluster:
        architecture: arm64
    ...
    files:
      # Rust Injector Binary
      - source: sget://defenseunicorns/zarf-injector:arm64-v0.20.0-32-alpha
      ...
```

We can now run `zarf init` on Windows.

```powershell
$ kind delete cluster && kind create cluster
$ make build-cli-windows-amd
$ make init-package
$ cd build
$ .\zarf-windows-amd-64.exe init

...

### Creating CI tests

Running Docker on Windows in Github CI is not an option currently. Full Stop.

So, only tests matching `src/test/e2e/[00-19]_*_test.go` (_this is not a real regular expression_) can be run.

Drawing from previous test workflows, namely `test-kind.yml` and `test-k3d.yml`, I drew up a Windows workflow:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/test-windows.yml
# parts of the configuration have been omitted due to overlap with other test files
# this showcase is only meant to highlight the differences in CI between windows and linux
name: test-windows

...

jobs:
  validate:
    runs-on: windows-latest
    steps:
      - name: "Dependency: Install Golang"
        uses: actions/setup-go@v3
        with:
          go-version: 1.19.x

      - name: "Dependency: Install Scoop+Make+NodeJS"
        shell: pwsh
        run: |
          Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -scope CurrentUser
          iex "& {$(irm get.scoop.sh)} -RunAsAdmin"
          Join-Path (Resolve-Path ~).Path "scoop\shims" >> $Env:GITHUB_PATH
          scoop install make@4.3 nodejs@16.17.1

      ...
      # this stuff in the middle is pretty 1:1 w/ the linux workflow

      - name: "Run Tests"
        shell: pwsh
        run: |
          make test-e2e ARCH=amd64 -e RUN_CLUSTER_TESTS=false
        #                           ^ this environment variable is later used to only run certain tests 

      - name: "Cleanup"
        shell: pwsh
        run: |
          Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .\build\
```

Ok, the CI workflow is done, but what happens when we run `make test-e2e`?  A f*ck ton of errors is what happens. This is the final hurdle, and I am still not 100% done.

To summarize:

- `examples/component-scripts` was broken because the scripts used `touch`, which doesn't exist on Windows
- `src/cmd/package.go` needed some regular expression adjusted to allow `\` and `:` as valid characters in Zarf's cache path
- `src/test/e2e/00_use_cli_test.go` needed an error message expectation tweak due to OS differences
- `src/test/e2e/20+` tests had code added to them to skip if the env var `RUN_CLUSTER_TESTS` is `false`

There is still __a lot__ to do, but getting Zarf fully Windows capable is nearly there.

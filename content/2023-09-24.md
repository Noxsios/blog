## The PackageSource Interface

In Go, interfaces are satisfied implicitly. This means that if a type has the same method signatures as an interface, it is considered to implement that interface. For package sources, this means that any type that implements the `PackageSource` interface can be used as a package source.

```go
// PackageSource is an interface for package sources.
//
// While this interface defines three functions, LoadPackage, LoadPackageMetadata, and Collect; only one of them should be used within a packager function.
//
// These functions currently do not promise repeatability due to the side effect nature of loading a package.
type PackageSource interface {
    // LoadPackage loads a package from a source.
    //
    // For the default sources included in Zarf, package integrity (checksums, signatures, etc.) is validated during this function
    // and expects the package structure to follow the default Zarf package structure.
    //
    // If your package does not follow the default Zarf package structure, you will need to implement your own source.
    LoadPackage(*layout.PackagePaths) error
    // LoadPackageMetadata loads a package's metadata from a source.
    //
    // This function follows the same principles as LoadPackage, with a few exceptions:
    //
    // - Package integrity validation will display a warning instead of returning an error if
    //   the package is signed but no public key is provided. This is to allow for the inspection and removal of packages
    //   that are signed but the user does not have the public key for.
    LoadPackageMetadata(dst *layout.PackagePaths, wantSBOM bool, skipValidation bool) error

    // Collect relocates a package from its source to a tarball in a given destination directory.
    Collect(destinationDirectory string) (tarball string, err error)
}
```

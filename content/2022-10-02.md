A collection of ludacrious, un-important, and downright pointless issues
I see while reading and writing documentation.

For this post I will use a fictional, completely chosen at random project name - `Large Explosion`

<!-- more -->

## Forward

Most of these issues can be easily remedied by having a documentation pipeline with the following tools:

- [`vale`](https://vale.sh/) - style guide as code, used by Gitlab, Microsoft, Github, etc...
- [`mdlint`](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint-cli2) - CommonMark compliant Markdown linter
- A linkchecker similar to the one used by this static-site generator - `zola check`
- [`prettier`](https://prettier.io/) - opinionated code formatter

## Titles

- Inconsitent Title naming
- Using H1 as the page title
- Using the product name in the document title

---

## Content

- Extrememly long paragraphs
- Writing non CommonMark compliant markdown
  - lists
  - blank space around headers
  - blank space around code blocks
  - using more than 3 backticks

---

## Flow

### Zero flow

### Storing code alongside docs

### Broken links

## Writing for multiple personas without a clear understanding of any

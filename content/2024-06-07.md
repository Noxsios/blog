> **TL;DR**

<!-- more -->

<!--

- take in interfaces, return structs (show example)
- explore type satisfaction via _ = `interface{}(T{})`
- use `context.Context` from the start, never embed it
- favor the standard library
- use `go vet` and `golint` (or `golangci-lint`)
- structs are not classes
- readable (and boring!) code is better than clever code
- document as you go, and let your tests inform your documentation
- `go test -coverprofile=coverage.out` `go tool cover -html=coverage.out`
- error wrapping is for the caller, don't wrap errors in your library
- Go is very readable, take the time to skim the library source code
- favor examples over explanations
- write library first, CLI second
- remember hyrum's law
- speed only matters if it's a problem, and it's usually not
